\title{Simulate a partially observed NB branching process with discrete generations}
\usage{
simulate_negbin(R, n, s, rho, t_max, over)
}
\arguments{
\item{R}{is the reproduction number, i.e. the average number of secondary cases due to a single case.
This can be any positive number. if R is a vector, then the length of R must be 'n' (see below).}

\item{n}{is the number of simulations performed. Each simulation start with 's'  individual(s) infected.
'n' must be a positive integer.}

\item{s}{is the number individual(s) initially infected. if s is a vector, then the length of s must be 'n' (see above).}

\item{rho}{is the probability (between 0 and 1) that an incident case is observed, i.e. reporting probability.
if rho is a vector, then the length of rho must be 'n' (see below)}

\item{t_max}{is the maximum number of generations simulated. 't_max' must be a positive integer.}

\item{over}{is the overdispersion in the offspring distribution.}
}
\value{
The function returns a list including:
\itemize{

\item true_incidence: the true incidence over time.

\item reported_incidence: the observed incidence over time accounting for under-reporting (rho).

\item observed_incidence: same as reported_incidence, but only including simulated outbreaks for which at least a
single case was observed (i.e. outbreak for which the observed final size is 0, see below reported_size, are removed).

\item true_size: the final outbreak sizes for each simulated outbreaks. Note that for outbreaks that are not extinct
'final' by the end of the simulation, z_sim correspond to the cumulative incidence by time t_max.

\item reported_size: the observed final outbreak sizes accounting for under-reporting (rho).

\item observed_size: same as reported_size, but only including simulated outbreaks for which at least a
single case was observed.

}

Note that if some simulated outbreaks are not extinct by the end of the simulation, a warning is displayed.

\description{
For a given reproduction number, this function simulate the incidence of a disease at each generation.
The offspring distribution of each individual infected is assumed to follow a NB distribution with mean
equal to the reproduction number. To simulate under-reporting, users can specify a probability to observe case,
 this reporting probability is assumed constant through the simulation.
