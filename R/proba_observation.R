#' @param y: a vector of outbreak sizes observations.
#' @param rho: the probability of a single case being detected.
#' @param threshold: the maximum true final size of an outbreak. this need to be much higher
#' than the largest observed outbreak to account for reporting and properly evaluate the distribution of outbreak sizes
#'
#' @return
#'  The function returns a list including:
#' \itemize{
#'
#' \item approx_R: a naive approximation of the reproduction number.
#'
#' \item y_obs_reformat: the observed incidence over time accounting for under-reporting (rho).
#'
#' \item possible_size: same as reported_incidence, but only including simulated outbreaks for which at least a
#' single case was observed (i.e. outbreak for which the observed final size is 0, see below reported_size, are removed).
#'
#' \item p_y_z: the probability of observing y given z,rho (reporting rate), with z the true number of cases (reported and un-reported cases)
#'
#' \item p_0_z: the probability of not observing an outbreak (i.e. y=0 or no cases) given z and rho.
